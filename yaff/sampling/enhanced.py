           **Arguments:**

           ff
                A ForceField instance

           cv
                A single ``CollectiveVariable`` or a list of ``CollectiveVariable``
                instances.

           sigma
                The width of the Gaussian or a NumPy array [Ncv] specifying the
                widths of the Gaussians

           K
                The prefactor of the Gaussian hills.

           **Optional arguments:**

           f
                A h5.File object to write the Gaussian hills to.

           start
                The first iteration at which a Gaussian hill should be added.

           step
                A Gaussian hill will be added every `step` iterations.

           restart_files
                A single h5 file containing hills added during previous
                simulations. Gaussian hills present in restart_files will
                be added at the start of the simulation.

           tempering
                Perform a well-tempered metadynamics simulation

           periodicities
                The periodicity of the single collective variable or a [Ncv]
                NumPy array specifying the periodicity of each
                collective variable. Specifying None means the CV is not
                periodic.

           comlist
                An optional layer to derive centers of mass from the atomic positions.
                These centers of mass are used as input for the first layer, the relative
                vectors.
