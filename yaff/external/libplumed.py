'''libplumed

   This module provides an interface to PLUMED, a library that includes
   enhanced sampling algorithms and free-energy methods.
'''


import numpy as np

from molmod.units import kjmol, nanometer, picosecond

from yaff.log import log, timer
from yaff.pes.ff import ForcePart
from yaff.sampling.iterative import Hook

__all__ = ['ForcePartPlumed']

class ForcePartPlumed(ForcePart, Hook):
    '''Biasing energies computed by PLUMED'''
    def __init__(self, system, timestep=0.0, restart=0,
                       fn='plumed.dat', kernel=None, fn_log='plumed.log'):
        r'''Initialize a PLUMED ForcePart. More information on the interface
            between PLUMED and MD codes can be found on
            http://tcb.ucas.ac.cn/plumed2/developer-doc/html/_how_to_plumed_your_m_d.html

            Unfortunately, PLUMED partially breaks the orthogonality of the pes
            and the sampling modules in Yaff: PLUMED sometimes requires
            information from the integrator. For example, in metadynamics
            PLUMED needs to know when a time integration step has been
            completed (which is not necessarily after each force calculation).
            ForcePartPlumed therefore also inherits from Hook and
            by attaching this hook to the integrator, it is possible to obtain
            the necessary information from the integrator. Problems within
            PLUMED for this approach to work, particularly in the VES module,
            have been resolved; see the discussion at
            https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/plumed-users/kPZu_tNZtgk

            **Optional Arguments:**

            timestep

                file.
